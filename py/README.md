# Python scripts

To use the scripts (`send_message.py`, `load_firmware.py` for example) go into the `x1-btc-psbt-firmware`
directory and run `pip3 install .`.

If you plan to work on the scripts run `pip3 install -e .` instead.

It is highly recommended that you use the dockerized setup while developing, guide for setting it up
can be found in [BUILD.md](../BUILD.md).
